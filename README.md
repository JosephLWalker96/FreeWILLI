### Installing Dependencies with Docker (Recommended)

1. Build Docker Image with a Custom Port

By default, it will use port 1045, but you can specify a custom port at build time:
```bash
cd listener_program/
docker build -t freewilli-exec .
```

2. Run the Container

You can run the container:
```bash
docker run --rm -it --network host --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):/app freewilli-exec
```
	
| Argument | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| --rm	| Removes the container after it exits to prevent leftover containers.|
| -it	| Runs the container in interactive mode (-i for input, -t for a TTY).|
| --network host	| Uses the host network instead of Docker's default bridge network. This allows the container to communicate with services on the host without port mapping.|
| --user $(id -u):$(id -g) |	Runs the container as the current user (id -u for user ID, id -g for group ID), preventing root-owned files on the host system.|
| -v $(pwd):/app	| Mounts the current directory ($(pwd)) to /app inside the container, allowing access to files from the host.|
| freewilli-exec	| The name of the Docker image to run.|

## Listener

### Technical Overview

Uses a **producer/consumer concurrency pattern** with threads created in ```src/main.cpp```. Shared data and synchronization are handled by ```SharedDataManager()``` from ```src/shared_data_manager.h```

Key architectural features include:

**Pipeline Execution Model**: Signal processing steps are executed sequentially using the Pipeline Pattern. The Pipeline class is created and initialized in ```src/main.cpp``` and it's method ```process()``` calls the main signal processing loop ```dataProcess()``` and wraps it in a ```try/catch``` block.

**Factory Pattern**: Objects for various algorithms (e.g., filters, detection modules) are dynamically created using a factory.

### Signal Processing Pipeline

The signal processing pipeline consists of the following main steps, executed sequentially:

1. *Time Domain Detection*: A time domain detector is applied to identify segments of interest. This step reduces computational overhead by filtering irrelevant data.

2. *Frequency Domain Transformation and Filtering*: The detected signal segments are transformed into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). If filtering is enabled, Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters are applied in the frequency domain to isolate frequency bands of interest. The filter coefficients are loaded from a configuration file in the ```filters/``` directory, and the frequency-domain representation is computed dynamically at runtime.

3. *Frequency Domain Detection*: A frequency domain detector is applied to identify segments of interest. This step reduces computational overhead by filtering irrelevant data.

4. *TDOA Estimation with GCC-PHAT*:
Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) is calculated using the Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) algorithm. 

5. *DOA Estimation*: The Direction of Arrival (DOA) of detected signals is estimated using a computationally efficient approach. This step leverages precomputed matrices derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the hydrophone position matrix. The hydrophone position matrix is loaded from a file in the ```receiver_pos/``` directory.

### Native Build: Linux & macOS

1. Build the program:
```bash
cd listener_program/
mkdir out/ && cd out
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

2. Run the binary:
```bash
cd ..
./bin/Listener config_files/volumetric.json 50000
```

### Cross-Compilation with Docker: Raspberry Pi Zero2W
This section provides step-by-step instructions to cross-compile your program for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W using Docker.

By using a prebuilt Docker image, you avoid manually setting up a cross-compilation toolchain on your local machine.

1. First, pull the prebuilt cross-compiler Docker image from Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull josephlwalker96/cross-compiler:latest
```

2. Navigate to the ```listener_program/``` directory and run the container:
```bash
cd listener_program/
docker run --rm -it --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):/app josephlwalker96/cross-compiler:latest
```

3. Inside the container, create a build directory and compile the program:
```bash
mkdir out/ && cd out
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchain.cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

4. After compilation, verify the generated binaries:
Cross-compiled binaries are denoted with an 'X' appended to their names.

```bash
ls ../bin/*
```

Expected output:
```bash
../bin/ListenX  ../bin/UnitTestsX
```

## Simulator

A Python-based simulator that streams prerecorded data packets over UDP. The simulator mimics the behavior of firmware-based data logging systems. It can read .npy files, process their contents (e.g., apply channel offsets for TDOA testing, scale the data, etc.), and send out structured UDP packets for testing the Listener program.

### File Structure
```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ datalogger_simulator.py   # The main simulation script
â”œâ”€â”€ firmware_config           # Firmware-specific configuration files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ firmware_1240.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ firmware_1550.py
â”œâ”€â”€ simulator_data            # Directory containing .npy data files
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py                  # Shared utility functions (e.g., data manipulation, concurrency helpers)
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt          # Python dependencies needed to run the simulator
```

- **datalogger_simulator.py**
This script is the simulator itself. It performs the following tasks:
1. Command-line argument parsing (to customize data streaming IP, port, etc.).
2. Loading data from .npy files.
3. (Optionally) applying channel duplication, shifting, stretching, glitches, and more.
4. Sending the processed data over UDP.

## Program Description
The simulator is designed to emulate a real-time data capture and logging system:

1. **Firmware Emulation:**
Selects firmware configuration (e.g., ```firmware_1240.py```) based on user arguments to determine packet structure and timing intervals.

2. **Data Streaming:**
Reads .npy data files (which contain raw sample data).
Preprocesses the data (e.g., interleaving, scaling, time-stamping).
Sends packets over UDP to a specified IP and port.

3. **Optional Features:**

- **Looping**: Repeatedly stream the same data files in a loop.
- **TDOA Simulation**: Applies channel offsets to simulate time-difference-of-arrival.
- **Glitches**: Intentionally modifies timestamps or data packets to test receiver robustness.
- **IMU Data**: Appends IMU packets if enabled, to simulate additional sensor data.


### Notes
**High Priority**: The simulator can set high priority (low niceness) for the process (using ```SetHighPriority()``` in ```utils.py```) if using a Unix based system.

**Multiprocessing**: Uses multiple processes to preload the next .npy file while the current one is streaming. This helps achieve smoother, more real-time data streaming.


### Run Example

1. **Prepare Data Files**

By default, the simulator program reads in data (.npy files) from the folder ```simulator_data/track132_5minchunks/```

[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UHr5gYuFRVvfLXsXLfc5mc5AA_aJcf_5?usp=drive_link) the ```track132_5minchunks/``` folder and place it in the ```simulator_data/``` directory.

2. **Run the Listener**

```bash
cd listener_program
./bin/Listener config_files/volumetric.json 50000
```

This will run the Listener program according to the specifications of the ```config_files/volumetric.json``` configuration file. The program will auomatically terminate after ```50000``` seconds.

3. **Run the Simulator**

```bash
python3 datalogger_simulator.py \
    --ip self \
    --port 1045 \
    --data_dir simulator_data/track132_5minchunks/ \
    --fw 1240 \
```

This example will by default load data from ```simulator_data/track132_5minchunks/``` and organize the data according to the firmware version ```1240```. The data is sent to to port ```1045``` at IP address ```self```, which is translated to the loopback address.
